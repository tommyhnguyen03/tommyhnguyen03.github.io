    <h4>Description of Game:</h4> <br>
    <p>Dinosaur Dash is a platforming game that has a dinosaur avoiding enemies in order to <br>
    reach the end.The scoring system that we added was a point system. Every time the dinosaur <br>
    passed one screen, the point would go up by 20 until 500 when the game would be won. <br>
    The use of randomness occurs with the stages as each screen is randomly picked. <br>
    Over time the game gets more progressively difficult as the first 200 points have <br>
    easier stages, and the next 260 have slighter harder stages, and the last stage <br>
    is the hardest. The game ends when the dinosaur touches an enemy where the player <br>
    would lose the game would end when the points hit 500 where the player would win.</p> <br>
    <h4>Reflection:</h4>
    <p>The game was created to have something fun to do to pass the time.The game was <br> 
    created with the idea of Super Mario Bros. in mind, but it was meant to be slightly <br>
    different as it went more off of a point system instead of levels. One successful <br>
    point was that we were able to create the concept of jumping and gravity where the <br>
    dinosaur would fall down after it jumped. Another successful point was when we also <br>
    implemented losing once the dinosaur touched an enemy. Both of these successes were <br>
    also obstacles, and to overcome them, we experimented various algorithms. If more time <br>
    was given, we would probably try to add more levels and try to change the end game.</p>
    <h4>Algorithm:</h4>
     <img src="algorithmdinodash.PNG" width=25% height=25%>
     <p>This is an algorithm because it has a set of instructions that are used <br>
     to do something. When the dinosaur reaches the right side of the screen, it will <br>
     get moved back to the left side of the screen, and the background would change. <br>
     Additionally, the point system would go up by 20, and each set of points have their <br>
     own set of stages. This essentially changes the stage that the player is playing, and <br>
     it would progressive the game, which is why it is a significant part of the game.</p>
